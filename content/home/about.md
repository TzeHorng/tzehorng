# About me

I am a graduate research assistant and MSc in Data Analytics candidate at the University of Houston - Downtown. My research interests include machine learning, data mining, image recognition, and developing custom functions and algorithms for my work. By creating this website (Datarology), I hope to share some of my Data Science works such as data cleaning, data manipulations, data exploration, analysis, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. At the same time, I would also like to get some feedbacks from the Data Science communities regarding my works so that I can improve myself and expand my knowledge.
